    "# NLP Processing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "There are quite a few steps in the whole processing part of natural language data. But in a traditional best-case scene, we can actually divide it into 9 separate simple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-01: Text Cleaning\n",
    "Removing irrelevant or noisy elements from the text. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Hey! 🙂 Check out this link ###https://abc.com!!!\"\n",
    ">> [\"Hey! Check out this link\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-02: Lowercasing\n",
    "Converting all text to lowercase letters for ensuring consisteny over all texts. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Hello, Adam Gross! I'm Senat Brown.\"\n",
    ">> [\"hello, Adam Gross! i'm Senat  Brown.\"] (✔ Preferable way)\n",
    ">> [\"hello, adam gross! i'm senat  brown.\"] (❌ Not Preferable as it looses Named Entity Recognition)\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-03: Sentence Segmentation\n",
    "Splitting different lines and sentences into separate entity. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Sally is mumbling. She might be nervous of speaking.\"\n",
    ">> [\"Sally is mumbling.\", \"She might be nervous of speaking.\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "★ Useful for parsing and document-level analysis\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-04: Tokenization\n",
    "Breaking sentences into preferable peices (Tokens) of words and symbols. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"I'm Gary Hunson. A DYI shop owner at Brisbey.\"\n",
    ">> [\"I'm\", \"Gary\", \"Hunson\", \".\", \"A\", \"DYI\", \"shop\", \"owner\", \"at\", \"Brisbey\", \".\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "★ Tokenization depends on the task in-hand and the context we're working with. It will be clear in upcoming notebooks.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-05: Normalization\n",
    "Standardizing text formats to ensure consistency over all type of texts. Oftenly results in better accuracy in classification related tasks. This includes:\n",
    "- Expanding Contraction (don't → do not)\n",
    "- Removing extra Punctuation (Hello!! → Hello!)\n",
    "- Converting Numbers to text [optional] (3 → three)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"I can't do 9 to 5 anymore!!!\"\n",
    ">> [\"I cannot do nine to five anymore!\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-06: Stopword Removal\n",
    "It is the process of eliminating very common words (am, was, is, to, a, an) that carry less standalone meaning in a sentence and often do not help a model distinguish between texts. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"I am learning representation learning techniques.\"\n",
    ">> [\"learning\", \"representation\", \"learning\", \"techniques\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "★ Removing stopwords:\n",
    "- Reduces noise in text\n",
    "- Reduces vocabulary size\n",
    "- Improves model efficieny\n",
    "- Focuses on content-bearing words\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-07: Stemming or Lemmatization\n",
    "**Stemming** is not always a good choice, but faster processing technique.\n",
    "> `studying → studi` | Faster processing but not a proper stem<br>\n",
    "> `running → run` | A proper stem\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **Lemmatization** is preferable and accurate in practice, but slower in processing.\n",
    "> `studying → study` | A proper lemma <br>\n",
    "> `running → run` | A proper lemma\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-08: Handling Rare Words and Noise\n",
    "Removing very unknown words and replaceing it with `<UNK>` token is often used for better processing. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"qwerty keyboard\"\n",
    ">> [<UNK>, \"keyboard\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-09: Vectorization\n",
    "This is a crucial and final process of converting the tokenized texts into numerical vector representation that machine can understand. This is done by various techniques, like:\n",
    "1. **Bag of Words (BoW)** = Represents text by counting the number of times each word appears and ignores the word order.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Text = \"learning representation learning techniques\"\n",
    "Tokens = [\"learning\", \"representation\", \"techniques\"]\n",
    "Vector = [2, 1, 1] (learning 2x, representation 1x, techniques 1x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)** = It improves BoW by reducing the importance of very common words (is, was, am) and highlighting distinctive words.<br>\n",
    "TF: how often a word appears in a document<br>\n",
    "IDF: how rare the word is across documents\n",
    "```\n",
    "learning → 0.32,        representation → 0.78,        techniques → 0.64\n",
    "Vector = [0.32, 0.78, 0.64]\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. **Word Embeddings** = Word embeddings represent each word as a dense numerical vector that captures semantic meaning. Words with similar meanings have similar vectors.<br>\n",
    "```\n",
    "learning        → [0.21, -0.34, 0.87, ...]\n",
    "representation  → [0.19, -0.30, 0.82, ...]\n",
    "techniques     → [0.25, -0.40, 0.90, ...]\n",
    "Key Learning:\n",
    "representation learning ≈ feature learning (the word \"feature\" would have quite similar vector like \"representation\"\n",
    "```"
